This is the online repository for the paper titled "Detecting Volatility Spillover Effects of Disturbances and Faults in A Chemical Process Plant Using Network Topology of Variance Decompositions" by D.L.B. Fortela and A.P. Mikolajczyk. This contains the Tennessee-Eastman chemical process (TEP) benchmark dataset, and the R-codes used to study volatility spillover effects using network topology of variance desompositions.

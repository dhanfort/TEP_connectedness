# Tennessee-Eastman chemical process (TEP) Connectedness

This is the online repository for the paper titled "Detecting Volatility Spillover Effects of Disturbances and Faults in A Chemical Process Plant Using Network Topology of Variance Decompositions" by D.L.B. Fortela and A.P. Mikolajczyk. This contains the Tennessee-Eastman chemical process (TEP) benchmark dataset, and the R-codes used to study volatility spillover effects using network topology of variance desompositions.


The TEP datasets used are those created and published by Rieth C.A., et al. (2017) : https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6C3JR1

The connectedness computations were implemented using the "ConnectednessApproach" R-package by	David Gabauer :https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ConnectednessApproach

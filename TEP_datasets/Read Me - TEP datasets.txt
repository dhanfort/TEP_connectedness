TEP Datasets:

Before running the R-codes, please download the TEP datasets from the publisher Harvard dataverse, which is open access.

The TEP dataset files are too large to be stored in this GitHub repo for the project.

The data files are in ".RData" format, which is the compatible data/workspace format when working in R.

Here is the TEP dataset URL: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6C3JR1
